# Analog-to-digital converter
## convertAD()
- convertAD() recieves the channel (1-12) on which to read the analog signal from
- It is better if convertAD() returns just the RES variable, instead of returning it already converted to voltage

## NOTE:
- This ADC function is not as precise as I would want it to be; will be uploading a better one
